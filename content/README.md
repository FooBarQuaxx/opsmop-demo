Executable Demos
================

This directory contains executable demos referenced in the OpsMop documentation at [opsmop.io](https://opsmop.io).

Please also be sure to read the 'module_docs' directory, as these examples are equally useful.
The module_docs are used to automatically generate the main module documentation and are also executable!
